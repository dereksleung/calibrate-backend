# Calibrate
A calorie tracker application, because I've gotten into healthier eating, jogging, and calisthenics.

Currently building out the backend as an Express.js app with clean architecture layering to decouple it from particular technology choices, and ideas from DDD to model the business logic. Will use the backend to explore/practice various backend topics.
